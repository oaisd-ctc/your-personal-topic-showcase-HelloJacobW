                    <p style="text-align:center;">Drawing has never been a good trait of mine until last year. Last year I tried to draw a fox out of a outbreak of ADHD energy. I thought it looked good so I kept retrying the same art over and over. Eventually over a little less than half the year I kept drawing the same design over and over and it got boring. One thing I did was draw the shell of the dog and give it to someone else to see what they would put in it. My little brother Noah put a striped pattern in the bandana that sparked an idea. Thats how Spot came around, then: Sprinkle, White beard, Red, Vertigo, Drako, Hi!, Paladin, and so on. Drawing characters has solved my boredom when writing notes in socail studies class. Doodles are what they are, but if you give it unique characteristics and a name then it becomes fun creatures. I did an art class where I learned a whole lot more about art. Unfortunately I couldn't doodle my way through that class and actually had to draw people. It was a lot of fun though, I show most of my creative looks on the world through art. Art gives more patience, and patience gives more memories, and memories is what to live for. All in all this is a good hobby, would recomend.</p>
