                <ol><li>Add a bandana</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>You could add a bandana with whatever desighn you want on it, it is how I started making character designs. Bandanas generally make it easier to draw and you can give a lot of character through them.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="2">Dog tail</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>You can add a dog tail and features to make your character a dog. Most of my unique characters are dogs.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="3">No mouth</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>Not drawing a mouth can give your character an expressionless or mysterious expression. It can add a lot to your character.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="4">Unique characteristics</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>For this character his unique thing is his right eye. This was my first character design and I am still proud of it to this day. You can do many things, for White beard (a pirate character, 3rd design) he has a beard that goes over his bandana, or one character who has a ghost for a tail.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="5">Accessories</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>You can add accessories to these animals. They don't mind if you draw them like they don't mind. I added an I eye patch to White beard. You can add sunglasses, earings, monicles, and bows.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="6">Hats</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>I know it could be said as an accessory or clothing. But Hats are the most versitile of them all. I once added an ice cream hat with a bandana with a ice cream cone design on a speckled silver fox. The name was Sprinkles(2nd design) There are so many hats that you can add to your character its incredible!</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="7">Clothing</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>It is the most difficult of the categories because it changes the whole design to match them. I only have a few hoodie characters and they are the ones that I don't usally draw because they are difficult to draw. You can give story with it like a scientist dog with a lab coat or construction vest. Add what you want.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="8">Positioning</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>This can be the hardest or easiest change. The back leg of Spot has a different back leg from the Fox. You can use eithor or. Other than the back leg flip the most common positions I use is ears and moving the right leg up.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="9">Items</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>Usually the reason I move the right leg up is when I have it holding something like a gun(taped to paw). Yes, a gun. You can draw dogs with what ever objects you want. Swords shields went well for the medieval knight Ive drawn. You can put jetpacks on their backs, there are unlimited possabilities with drawing</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="10" style="font-size:1.75em">Coat of fur</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>Changing the coat of fur makes or breaks a character you're making. You can give it different coats depending on what type of animal you are making. Different patterns is the most important thing to make your character unique. Like how Spot's coat makes his character more than anything.</article>
