                <ol><li>Add a bandana</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>You could add a bandana with whatever desighn you want on it, it is how I started making character designs. Bandanas generally make it easier to draw and you can give a lot of character through them.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="2">Dog tail</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>You can add a dog tail and features to make your character a dog. Most of my unique characters are dogs.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="3">No mouth</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>Not drawing a mouth can give your character an expressionless or mysterious expression. It can add a lot to your character.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="4">Unique characteristics</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>For this character his unique thing is his right eye. This was my first character design and I am still proud of it to this day. You can do many things, for White beard (a pirate character, 3rd design) he has a beard that goes over his bandana, or one character who has a ghost for a tail.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="5">Accessories</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>You can add accessories to these animals. They don't mind if you draw them like they don't mind. I added an I eye patch to White beard. You can add sunglasses, earings, monicles, and bows.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="6">Hats</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>I know it could be said as an accessory or clothing. But Hats are the most versitile of them all. I once added an ice cream hat with a bandana with a ice cream cone design on a speckled silver fox. The name was Sprinkles(2nd design) There are so many hats that you can add to your character its incredible!</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="7">Clothing</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>It is the most difficult of the categories because it changes the whole design to match them. I only have a few hoodie characters and they are the ones that I don't usally draw because they are difficult to draw. You can give story with it like a scientist dog with a lab coat or construction vest. Add what you want.</article>
                    </div>
                <ol><li value="8">Positioning</li></ol>
                    <div>
                        <article>This can be the hardest or easiest change. The back leg of Spot has a different back leg from the Fox. You can use eithor or. Other than the back leg flip the most common positions I use is ears and moving the right leg up.</article>
