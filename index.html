               <article>First start at the mid-point of your page or where ever you are drawing this cartoon fox. From there you will make a arching curve up to the left, and then go back down with the same arch. You will repeat this process one more time. Then you will make one last arch to make an arrow at the top and come back down with a reverse of the previous arch. Then await step 2.</article>
